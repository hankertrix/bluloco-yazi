# Bluloco flavours for [Yazi]

Bluloco is a theme originally created by @uloco for
Neovim ([bluloco.nvim]) and VSCode
([Bluloco Light][theme-bluloco-light], [Bluloco Dark][theme-bluloco-dark]).

These Yazi flavours attempt to be a faithful adaptation of the original theme,
making use of the colours in the [Neovim theme][bluloco.nvim]
to create these [Yazi] flavours.

Currently, these flavours require the use of the **nightly version** of Yazi,
and **will not work** properly with Yazi 25.5.31.

Click the links below for the light and dark flavours respectively.
